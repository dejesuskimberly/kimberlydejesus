	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h2>Hello!</h2>
	<p>My name is Kimberly Mae S. De Jesus and I am 21 years old. I currently reside in Camella Homes 4A, Poblacion Muntilupa City. My birthday is on July 9, 2002. I come from a loving family, with my parents being Aileen De Jesus and Vicente De Jesus Jr. I also have an older brother named Emmanuel De Jesus. We are only two children in out family.</p>
	
	<p>I am currently pursuing my education at Pamanrasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlup, where I am taking a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am excited to be part of the Human Computer Interaction subject this semester as I hope to gain a deeper understanding of the field and have an enjoyable learning experience.</p>
		
	<p>In five years from now, I envision myself working in my dream country, Japan. I plan to apply the knowledge and skills I have gained from my Computer Science course to my job there, focusing on computer and technology-related tasks. I am determined to excel in my chosen career path and make the most out of my education.</p>
